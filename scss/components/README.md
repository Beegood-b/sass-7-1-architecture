## The *components* folder contains SCSS files for reusable UI elements that are used throughout the project. These elements are often self-contained and modular, making it easy to manage and update individual pieces of the UI. Each file in this folder typically corresponds to a specific visual or functional component.

## Files in *components*:
### _buttons.scss:
Styles for all button elements across the project. This file includes different button variants (e.g., primary, secondary, outline) and handles button states such as hover, focus, and active. The aim is to ensure a consistent look and feel for all buttons.

### _cards.scss:
Defines styles for card components, which are typically used to group related information. This file includes structure and layout settings, such as padding, borders, shadows, and responsive behavior for cards across different screen sizes.

### _forms.scss:
Contains global styles for form elements, including labels, input fields, text areas, checkboxes, and radio buttons. This file ensures that form elements have a cohesive appearance and proper spacing throughout the project.

### _inputs.scss:
Provides detailed styling specifically for form input fields. This file addresses the appearance of text inputs, password fields, and other input types, managing states like focus, validation error, and disabled.

### _modals.scss:
Handles the styling for modal components, which are pop-up or overlay windows. This file includes settings for the modalâ€™s appearance, positioning, and animations, as well as structure for modal headers, bodies, and footers.
