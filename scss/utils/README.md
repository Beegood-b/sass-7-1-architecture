## The *utils* folder contains utility SCSS files that provide reusable helper classes, functions, and structural utilities. These files are designed to handle common styling needs, enabling developers to apply consistent styles across the project with minimal effort. The utilities in this folder are typically low-level styles or helper functions that can be applied to multiple components or layouts.

## Files in *utils*:
### _color-utils.scss:
Contains utility functions and mixins for manipulating colors, such as darkening, lightening, or adjusting transparency. This file makes it easier to work with the project's color palette and ensures consistent color manipulation throughout the stylesheets.

### _container.scss:
Defines utility classes and mixins for creating responsive containers and managing layout width. This file handles settings like maximum width, padding, and margin auto-centering for consistent layout structure.

### _flow.scss:
Contains utilities that manage the spacing and flow of elements, such as margin and padding helpers. It provides spacing utilities that can be applied to control the vertical or horizontal space between elements without writing custom CSS each time.

### _helpers.scss:
Provides utility classes for common, reusable patterns such as visually hidden elements (for accessibility), clearfix, and responsive visibility utilities. These classes help with accessibility and layout tweaks without introducing additional custom styles.
