# The *vendors* folder contains third-party libraries and styles that are imported into the project. These stylesheets are generally not modified directly, as they come from external sources. Instead, they provide base styling or functionality that complements your custom SCSS code.

## Files in *vendors*:
### _bootstrap.scss:
Contains the Bootstrap frameworkâ€™s CSS, providing a robust set of pre-built components, grid systems, and utility classes. Bootstrap is used to quickly build responsive, mobile-first layouts and UI elements without needing to write custom styles from scratch.

### _normalize.scss:
Includes the Normalize.css library, which ensures that browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. Normalize resets or normalizes browser defaults, providing a stable starting point for custom styles across different browsers.
